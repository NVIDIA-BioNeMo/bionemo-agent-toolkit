# Parabricks starfusion

Collect STAR `Chimeric.out.junction`, the CTAT/STAR-Fusion genome resource
library, and an output directory. Raw RNA FASTQs first need compatible junction
generation, for example through [rna_fq2bam](pbrun-rna_fq2bam.md); this tool is
not a raw-read aligner. Check junction format, library compatibility, and the
expected fusion result files. Select optional filters and interpret fusion
calls using project-specific filtering and validation criteria.

## Command Shape

Fusion detection from chimeric junction input:

```bash
pbrun starfusion \
  --chimeric-junction /workdir/<chimeric_junction.out> \
  --genome-lib-dir /workdir/<genome_resource_library>/ \
  --output-dir /outputdir/<starfusion_output>/
```

## STAR-Fusion Option Mapping

Parabricks v4.7.0 exposes a focused subset of the
STAR-Fusion CLI: the chimeric junction input, CTAT genome resource library,
output directory, output prefix, and worker thread count. Many upstream
STAR-Fusion filtering, STAR-alignment, FusionInspector, shared-memory, and
single-cell options are not exposed by `pbrun starfusion`; if the selected
Parabricks version does not document a flag, do not pass it through.

If a requested upstream filter or FusionInspector mode is mandatory, explain
that the supported `pbrun starfusion` command is only a partial migration.
Retain the upstream stage, or plan a separately validated downstream stage;
do not claim that dropping an unsupported option preserves the analysis.
Upstream FusionInspector also needs the read inputs, not just the junction
file. The CTAT/STAR-Fusion resource library is distinct from a plain STAR
alignment index, even when both come from the same reference build.

| STAR-Fusion option | `pbrun starfusion` equivalent | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--chimeric_junction`, `-J` | `--chimeric-junction` | Required path to `Chimeric.out.junction` from STAR. |
| `--genome_lib_dir` | `--genome-lib-dir` | Required CTAT/STAR-Fusion genome resource library directory. |
| `--output_dir`, `-O` | `--output-dir` | Required output directory. |
| `--out_prefix` | `--out-prefix` | Same output-prefix role. |
| `--CPU` | `--num-threads` | Same worker-thread role; Parabricks default is version-specific. |

| `--version` | `--version` | Same version-reporting role. |
| `--verbose_level` | `--verbose` | Partial equivalent only: Parabricks exposes a boolean verbose flag, not STAR-Fusion's numeric verbosity level. |
| `--left_fq` | No direct equivalent | `pbrun starfusion` starts from a STAR chimeric junction file, not raw FASTQ. Use `pbrun-rna_fq2bam.md` or STAR first to produce compatible junction input. |

| `--misc_FI_opts` | No direct equivalent | Upstream FusionInspector pass-through option not exposed by current Parabricks docs. |
| `--run_STAR_only` | No direct equivalent | `pbrun starfusion` does not run STAR alignment; it consumes STAR chimeric junction output. |
| `--STAR_PATH` | No direct equivalent | Does not expose a STAR executable path for `pbrun starfusion`. |
| `--STAR_twopass` | No direct equivalent | STAR-alignment option not exposed because this Parabricks command consumes existing junctions. |
