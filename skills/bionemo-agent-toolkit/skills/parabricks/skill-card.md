## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
7 evaluation tasks (6 positive, 1 negative) run in isolated sandbox pods; dataset digest sha256:23088600f666e241. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Verifies final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the expected skill was selected and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Tool-call productivity (50%) and token efficiency (50%). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys avoided, and workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code | Codex |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 97.5% | 92.1% |
| Security | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| Correctness | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| Discoverability | 100.0% | 82.5% |
| Effectiveness | 95.7% | 93.9% |
| Efficiency | 91.9% | 84.2% |
