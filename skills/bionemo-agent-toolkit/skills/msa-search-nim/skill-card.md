## Description: <br>
Generate multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for protein sequences using the ColabFold MSA-Search NIM. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers use this skill to generate multiple sequence alignments for protein sequences via GPU-accelerated MMSeqs2. Hosted NVIDIA API and local Docker NIM support homolog search and paired MSA for complexes; structural template retrieval requires a local Docker NIM. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Yes] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [API key] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 1 task (1 positive case, 3 attempts per task) in isolated k8s-sandbox pods. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was selected and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks goal completion (50%) and expected workflow adherence (50%). <br>
- Efficiency: Checks tool-call productivity (50%) and token efficiency (50%). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>

| Correctness | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 100.0% → 0.0% (-100.0 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 95.0% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
| Effectiveness | 67.9% → 100.0% (+32.1 points) | 100.0% → 95.0% (-5.0 points) |
| Efficiency | 77.4% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 78.8% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
