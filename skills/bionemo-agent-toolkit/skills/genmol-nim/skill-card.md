## Description: <br>
Generate novel drug-like molecules using the GenMol NIM microservice for de novo generation, scaffold decoration, motif extension, lead optimization, SAFE notation, QED or LogP ranking, hosted NVIDIA API calls, or local Docker deployment. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and computational chemists use this skill to generate novel drug-like molecules for early-stage drug discovery, including de novo generation, scaffold decoration, motif extension, and lead optimization with QED or LogP ranking. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive), 3 attempts per task, evaluated in isolated k8s-sandbox pods. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill avoids unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded and activated when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the user's goal and expected workflow. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool calls and token usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys avoided, and workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity; routing scored under Discoverability. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
